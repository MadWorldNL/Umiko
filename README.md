# Umiko
This repository is a personal collection of small tools, experiments, and utilities I've built while learning and exploring
new technologies. It brings together prototypes, scripts, automations, and various side projects that helped me try out
ideas or streamline my workflow. You'll also find my CV included, offering a snapshot of my background, skills, and the
projects I’m currently working on.

## Installation
Run `dotnet tool install --global Aspire.Cli --version 13.0.1`

## Kubernetes
Run `aspire publish -o Artifacts/Kubernetes`

## About the name
Umiko (海子) is a Japanese name meaning “child of the sea,” making it a fitting and whimsical choice for a sea turtle. 
It evokes imagery of calm waves, ocean depth, and gentle marine life. In my project Umiko serves as a fun mascot
representing curiosity, exploration, and the peaceful nature of the sea.
