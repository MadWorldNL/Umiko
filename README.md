# Umiko

Umiko (海子) is a Japanese name meaning “child of the sea,” making it a fitting and whimsical choice for a sea turtle. 
It evokes imagery of calm waves, ocean depth, and gentle marine life. In my project Umiko serves as a fun mascot
representing curiosity, exploration, and the peaceful nature of the sea.
